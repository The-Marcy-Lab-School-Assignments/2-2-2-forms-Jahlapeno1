# Question

Say I have a form on a page with an input for a user's email and password. When you click the submit button, suddenly the url goes from:

```plaintext
https://localhost:8000/
```

to this:

```plaintext
https://localhost:8000/?email=tom%40gmail.com&password=123456
```

The whole page refreshed as well. Why did that happen, and how can we stop it?

# Answer

The whole page refreshed because the default behavior of a form when submitted is to refresh the page and append the data from the form to the url. We can stop this by preventing the default behavior of the form submission.
